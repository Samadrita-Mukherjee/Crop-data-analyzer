This project focuses on analyzing crop yield data from different states of India to study how factors like rainfall, fertilizer, and pesticide usage influence agricultural productivity. Using Python for data analysis and visualization, the project aims to identify yield trends, compare state-wise performance, and explore the relationships between various agricultural inputs and outputs.
